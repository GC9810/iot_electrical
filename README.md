## Objective

1.	Develop a power meter that can real time measure the following parameter:
 -	Voltage and Current RMS value
 -	Power factor and Frequency
 -	Active, reactive power
 -	Temperature
 
2. Notify for abnormalities event by email, such as over-temperature and case tampering
3. Visualize the measurement to a cloud dashboard and 1602 LCD (Thingsboard)
4. Detect of energy-theft activities of case tampering
5. Implement a real-time data monitoring interface locally by ESP32 and 1602 LCD display
6. Deploy a server that can store the reading in secure and user-friendly way
7. Provide voice control feature for disabilities and unskilled user (via iOS Siri)
8. NTP Clock synchronization
9. Upload the reading to Thingsboard (dashobard) via MQTT protocol
10. Design a laser cutted acrylic case to enclose the components
